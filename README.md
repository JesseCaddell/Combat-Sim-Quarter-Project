# Combat-Sim-Quarter-Project
Completed final project. Still needs CSS and HTML separated.
Having issues with sound effects. Initial basic attacks trigger the sound immediately. Block and the special ability for each class have a delayed effect and trigger after the alert box. Seems to happen only once and then it catches up.
